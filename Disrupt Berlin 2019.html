hacker only needs to win once, but businesses have to get it right every single time.<\/p>\n<p>Not every company faces the same field of threats. That&#8217;s what makes security particularly difficult \u2014 there are no panaceas, and the cybersecurity startup field is crowded. So much so, some entrepreneurs complain that the vast number of solutions on the market are weighing down chief security officers with a deluge of data but not the clear visibility they need.<\/p>\n<p>Or, as one of the cybersecurity-focused VCs we surveyed called it: &#8220;startup fatigue.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Many of the rising cybersecurity startups focus on the same or overlapping problems could lead to a &#8220;cybersecurity consolidation,&#8221; one that&#8217;s dictated by customers and not necessarily the businesses themselves.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s usually one element that feeds into everything \u2014 data.<\/p>\n<p>As hacks and breaches become more common, companies and customers alike are reevaluating their relationships with data. Customers want more ownership of their data and the ability to give it out granularly, while an increasing number of businesses are shifting away from central banks of data and leaning towards a &#8220;zero data&#8221; approach.<\/p>\n<p>By minimizing the amount of information companies store or collect, it&#8217;s validation that even some larger startups don&#8217;t even trust themselves to secure data properly.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, there&#8217;s as much mistrust inside their own networks. That&#8217;s where &#8220;zero trust&#8221; comes into play \u2014 where you don&#8217;t trust, but you certainly verify. The idea is that you get no extra special access inside a company&#8217;s four walls. Many big companies, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/21\/tips-founders-should-know-securing-their-startup\/\">like Google<\/a>, treat all employees the as if they present the same level of security risk whether they&#8217;re in the office, at home, or in a coffee shop down the street.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou should be able to run your whole business out of a Starbucks,\u201d said <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> security chief Heather Adkins at Disrupt SF.<\/p>\n<p>Why the mistrust? Because security isn&#8217;t just a technology problem, it&#8217;s a people problem. And it&#8217;s not only people creating the solutions, it&#8217;s people with the solutions to create these startups to begin with.<\/p>\n<p>We asked ten leading cybersecurity VCs who work at firms that span early to growth stages to share where they see opportunity in this sector:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amit Karp<\/strong>, Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bvp.com\/team\/amit-karp\/\">Bessemer Venture Partners<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Rama Sekhar<\/strong>, Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nvp.com\/team\/rama-sekhar\/\">Norwest Venture Partners<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Ping Li<\/strong>, Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accel.com\/team\/ping-li\">Accel<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Saam Motamedi<\/strong>, Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greylock.com\/team\/#saam-motamedi\">Greylock<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Deepak Jeevankumar<\/strong>, Managing Director at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.delltechnologies.com\/en-us\/capital\/ventures\/team.htm#accordion0=&amp;accordion1=&amp;accordion2=&amp;overlay-bio3=1\">Dell Technologies Capital<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Lenard Marcus<\/strong>, General Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edisonpartners.com\/team\/lenard-marcus\">Edison Partners<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Arun Mathew<\/strong>, Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accel.com\/team\/arun-mathew\">Accel<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Matt Carbonara<\/strong>, Managing Director at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.citi.com\/ventures\/bio\/matt-carbonara.html\">Citi Ventures<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Matt Robinson<\/strong>, Vice President at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tcv.com\/team\/matt-robinson\/\">TCV<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Enrique Salem<\/strong>, Partner at Bain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.baincapitalventures.com\/team\/enrique\/\">Capital Ventures<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, we did a deep-dive interview with\u00a0<strong>Arif Janmohamed\u00a0<\/strong>at <a href=\"https:\/\/lsvp.com\/team\/arif-janmohamed\/\">Lightspeed<\/a> about <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/29\/the-future-of-cybersecurity-vc-investing-with-lightspeeds-arif-janmohamed\/\">how he and his firm are targeting the sector and what he sees as the next-generation of cybersecurity startups<\/a>.

I believe CISOs are tired of deploying additional security products which for the most part have overlapping functionality. So I am very cautious with additional tools that are deployed inside the enterprise perimeter (network, endpoint, etc.).\u00a0 I am looking for companies that can be deployed quickly and demonstrate immediate value to CISOs, and do not overwhelm the CISO with many new alerts.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>What are the most interesting trends in the space, particularly ones you think are under-appreciated by other investors?<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I think there are still many opportunities to improve application security. The combination of every company becoming a software company on the one hand and development environments becoming more chaotic on the other hand, results in many new risks and opportunities in securing your software. This includes securing third-party APIs or open-source components which are outside your control and giving developers and devops engineers more security tools while not hindering the pace of development.<\/p>\n<p>Another interesting trend is micro-segmentation and authorization \u2014 with the adoption of zero-trust frameworks and authentication becoming a solved problem \u2014 deciding who gets access to what has become increasingly important.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Are there any startups in cybersecurity you wish existed, but haven&#8217;t seen yet?<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Security is one of the toughest things to get right; a hacker only needs to win once, but businesses have to get it right every single time.

The company raised a $55 million round of financing in 2016, $60 million in 2017 and $100 million in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>For investors, what makes the company compelling (beyond its string of successful games) is the technology platform that undergirds its popular mobile gaming titles. &#8220;What the company allows you to do is look at engagement and alter a game midstream to tailor the experience,&#8221; says Ravi Viswanathan, the founder and managing partner of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/newview-capital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"newview-capital\">NewView Capital <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>NewView, a growth-stage venture capital firm spun out of the multibillion-dollar investment firm NEA, led the most recent $200 million round for Scopely.<\/p>\n<p>Scopely is the firm&#8217;s first major investment in a gaming company and was part of a portfolio of investments that NewView took over when it spun off from NEA.<\/p>\n<p>For Scopely, the latest capital infusion is just more money in the bank to invest in or acquire budding game studios and give them access to the technology stack that has made Scopely so compelling, according to Driver.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Our technology platform is about optimizing free digital experiences for the largest amount of players possible,&#8221; Driver says. &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re primarily focused on finding the most passionate and talented game developers that want to specialize in making the kind of game design and might have the kind of specialized expertise that we admire.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the eight years since Scopely first launched, the gaming industry has been transformed by the opportunities that exist in the mobile market &#8212; and both Scopely and companies like Jam City have capitalized on the new platform.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We see the future of gaming as free live services that give users choice and agency of how they want to play,&#8221; says Driver. &#8220;Being able to refine those live services over time and react to the data that you&#8217;re seeing and optimize those products,&#8221; has been at the core of Scopely&#8217;s technology stack.<\/p>\n<p>The company is already raking in more than $400 million in annualized revenue and it was that growth that convinced NewView and investors like the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board to commit capital as part of this latest round.<\/p>\n<p>Scopely has already made a few select minority investments in gaming studios, and with the new cash, Driver hopes to roll up more independent game developers.<\/p>\n<p>*This story has been updated to indicate that Scopely&#8217;s valuation is $1.7 billion.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/whatsapp\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"whatsapp\">WhatsApp <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> has filed a suit in federal court accusing Israeli mobile surveillance maker NSO Group of creating an exploit that was used hundreds of times to hack into target&#8217;s phone.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/6532395-WhatsApp-complaint.html\">lawsuit<\/a>, filed in a California federal court, said the mobile surveillance outfit &#8220;developed their malware in order to access messages and other communications after they were decrypted&#8221; on target devices.<\/p>\n<p>The attack worked by exploiting <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/13\/whatsapp-exploit-let-attackers-install-government-grade-spyware-on-phones\/\">an audio-calling vulnerability in WhatsApp<\/a>. Users may\u00a0 appear to get an ordinary call, but the malware would quietly infect the device with spyware, giving the attackers full access to the device.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases it happened so quickly, the target&#8217;s phone may not have rung at all.<\/p>\n<p>Because WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, it&#8217;s near-impossible to access the messages as they traverse the internet. But in recent years, governments and mobile spyware companies have begun targeting the devices where the messages were sent or received. The logic goes that if you hack the device, you can obtain its data.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what WhatsApp says happened.<\/p>\n<p>WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, quickly <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/13\/whatsapp-exploit-let-attackers-install-government-grade-spyware-on-phones\/\">patched the vulnerability<\/a>. Although blame fell fast on NSO Group, WhatsApp did not publicly accuse the company at the time \u2014 until now.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/2019\/10\/29\/why-whatsapp-is-pushing-back-nso-group-hacking\/\">an op-ed<\/a> posted shortly after the suit was filed, WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said the messaging giant &#8220;learned that the attackers used servers and Internet-hosting services that were previously associated&#8221; with NSO Group, and that certain WhatsApp accounts used during the attacks were traced back to the company.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;While their attack was highly sophisticated, their attempts to cover their tracks were not entirely successful,&#8221; said Cathcart.<\/p>\n<p>The attack involved disguising the malicious code as call settings, allowing the surveillance outfit to deliver the code as if it came from WhatsApp&#8217;s signaling servers. Once the malicious calls were delivered to the target&#8217;s phone, they &#8220;injected the malicious code into the memory of the target device \u2014 even when the target did not answer the call,&#8221; the complaint read.

For example, you could type &#8220;doc.new&#8221; (without the quotes) to create a new Google Doc or &#8220;sheet.new&#8221; to create a new spreadsheet. Today, Google announced it&#8217;s bringing the .new shortcuts to the rest of the web. Now, any company or organization can register their own .new domain to generate a .new shortcut that works with their own web app. Several have already done so, including Microsoft, which now has &#8220;word.new&#8221; to start a new word document, or Spotify, which has &#8220;playlist.new&#8221; to start adding songs to a new playlist on its streaming app.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-1905097 alignright\" title=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-29 at 10.24.01 AM\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.24.01-AM.png?w=616\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019 10 29 at 10.24.01 AM\" width=\"471\" height=\"519\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.24.01-AM.png 1238w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.24.01-AM.png?resize=136,150 136w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.24.01-AM.png?resize=272,300 272w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.24.01-AM.png?resize=768,847 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.24.01-AM.png?resize=616,680 616w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.24.01-AM.png?resize=45,50 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" \/>The domains are designed to get users straight to the action. That is, instead of having to visit a service, sign in, then find the right menu or function, they could just start creating.<\/p>\n<p>However, some of today&#8217;s new domains aren&#8217;t quite as seamless as Google&#8217;s own. Because most Google Docs users are already signed in to Google, it&#8217;s easy to jump right to creating a new online document.<\/p>\n<p>But other services aren&#8217;t used as often.

This doesn&#8217;t make it necessarily any easier to use Medium &#8212; a better use case would have allowed the user to just start writing, saving their text under a temporary account, then prompt them to join Medium upon exit or clicking &#8220;publish.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft&#8217;s word.new, a direct rival to Google&#8217;s own doc.new, isn&#8217;t yet resolving. (Google tells us some of the shortcuts aren&#8217;t yet ready, but should be soon.)<\/p>\n<p>Other participants include sell.new (eBay), canva.new and design.new (Canva), reservation.new (OpenTable), webex.new and letsmeet.new (Cisco WebEx meeting room creation), link.new (Bit.ly), invoice.new (Stripe&#8217;s dashboard), api.new (launch new Node.js API endpoints from RunKit), Coda.new (Coda), music.new (create personalized song artwork for OVO Sound artist releases and more) and repo.new (GitHub).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify also picked up podcast.new, which takes you to Anchor, in addition to playlist.new.<\/p>\n<p>Considering the lineup, it&#8217;s clear that there&#8217;s not as much of a gold rush for these action-based domains as there are for other top-level domains. There are some fun use cases, like Spotify&#8217;s, and practical ones like word.new, but others are less compelling because they drop you on sign-up\/sign-in pages because they&#8217;re not everyday services.<\/p>\n<p>And some are just odd land grabs. Like Ovo Sound, the record label founded by Drake, which snagged &#8220;music.new&#8221; &#8212; a domain that you would think would go to a larger streaming service. (In fact, it&#8217;s somewhat surprising that Google&#8217;s own music service, YouTube Music, didn&#8217;t grab that one for itself.)<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1905099\" title=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-29 at 10.31.11 AM\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.31.11-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019 10 29 at 10.31.11 AM\" width=\"680\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.31.11-AM.png 2476w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.31.11-AM.png?resize=150,72 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.31.11-AM.png?resize=300,144 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.31.11-AM.png?resize=768,368 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.31.11-AM.png?resize=680,326 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-10.31.11-AM.png?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google says any company can register these domains, all of which are secured over HTTPS connections like .app, .page and .dev domains are.<\/p>\n<p>Through January 14, 2020, trademark owners can register their trademarked .new domains.

hacker only needs to win once, but businesses have to get it right every single time.<\/p>\n<p>Not every company faces the same field of threats. That&#8217;s what makes security particularly difficult \u2014 there are no panaceas, and the cybersecurity startup field is crowded. So much so, some entrepreneurs complain that the vast number of solutions on the market are weighing down chief security officers with a deluge of data but not the clear visibility they need.<\/p>\n<p>Or, as one of the cybersecurity-focused VCs we surveyed called it: &#8220;startup fatigue.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Many of the rising cybersecurity startups focus on the same or overlapping problems could lead to a &#8220;cybersecurity consolidation,&#8221; one that&#8217;s dictated by customers and not necessarily the businesses themselves.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s usually one element that feeds into everything \u2014 data.<\/p>\n<p>As hacks and breaches become more common, companies and customers alike are reevaluating their relationships with data. Customers want more ownership of their data and the ability to give it out granularly, while an increasing number of businesses are shifting away from central banks of data and leaning towards a &#8220;zero data&#8221; approach.<\/p>\n<p>By minimizing the amount of information companies store or collect, it&#8217;s validation that even some larger startups don&#8217;t even trust themselves to secure data properly.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, there&#8217;s as much mistrust inside their own networks. That&#8217;s where &#8220;zero trust&#8221; comes into play \u2014 where you don&#8217;t trust, but you certainly verify. The idea is that you get no extra special access inside a company&#8217;s four walls. Many big companies, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/21\/tips-founders-should-know-securing-their-startup\/\">like Google<\/a>, treat all employees the as if they present the same level of security risk whether they&#8217;re in the office, at home, or in a coffee shop down the street.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou should be able to run your whole business out of a Starbucks,\u201d said <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> security chief Heather Adkins at Disrupt SF.<\/p>\n<p>Why the mistrust? Because security isn&#8217;t just a technology problem, it&#8217;s a people problem. And it&#8217;s not only people creating the solutions, it&#8217;s people with the solutions to create these startups to begin with.<\/p>\n<p>We asked ten leading cybersecurity VCs who work at firms that span early to growth stages to share where they see opportunity in this sector:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amit Karp<\/strong>, Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bvp.com\/team\/amit-karp\/\">Bessemer Venture Partners<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Rama Sekhar<\/strong>, Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nvp.com\/team\/rama-sekhar\/\">Norwest Venture Partners<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Ping Li<\/strong>, Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accel.com\/team\/ping-li\">Accel<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Saam Motamedi<\/strong>, Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greylock.com\/team\/#saam-motamedi\">Greylock<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Deepak Jeevankumar<\/strong>, Managing Director at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.delltechnologies.com\/en-us\/capital\/ventures\/team.htm#accordion0=&amp;accordion1=&amp;accordion2=&amp;overlay-bio3=1\">Dell Technologies Capital<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Lenard Marcus<\/strong>, General Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edisonpartners.com\/team\/lenard-marcus\">Edison Partners<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Arun Mathew<\/strong>, Partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accel.com\/team\/arun-mathew\">Accel<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Matt Carbonara<\/strong>, Managing Director at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.citi.com\/ventures\/bio\/matt-carbonara.html\">Citi Ventures<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Matt Robinson<\/strong>, Vice President at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tcv.com\/team\/matt-robinson\/\">TCV<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Enrique Salem<\/strong>, Partner at Bain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.baincapitalventures.com\/team\/enrique\/\">Capital Ventures<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, we did a deep-dive interview with\u00a0<strong>Arif Janmohamed\u00a0<\/strong>at <a href=\"https:\/\/lsvp.com\/team\/arif-janmohamed\/\">Lightspeed<\/a> about <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/29\/the-future-of-cybersecurity-vc-investing-with-lightspeeds-arif-janmohamed\/\">how he and his firm are targeting the sector and what he sees as the next-generation of cybersecurity startups<\/a>.

I believe CISOs are tired of deploying additional security products which for the most part have overlapping functionality.

The combination of every company becoming a software company on the one hand and development environments becoming more chaotic on the other hand, results in many new risks and opportunities in securing your software. This includes securing third-party APIs or open-source components which are outside your control and giving developers and devops engineers more security tools while not hindering the pace of development.<\/p>\n<p>Another interesting trend is micro-segmentation and authorization \u2014 with the adoption of zero-trust frameworks and authentication becoming a solved problem \u2014 deciding who gets access to what has become increasingly important.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Are there any startups in cybersecurity you wish existed, but haven&#8217;t seen yet?<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Security is one of the toughest things to get right; a hacker only needs to win once, but businesses have to get it right every single time.

of enterprise startups: those that create value and those that protect value. Cybersecurity is most definitely part of the latter group, and as a vertical, it has sprawled the past few years as the scale of attacks on companies, organizations, and governments has continuously expanded.<\/p>\n<p>That may be a constant threat for the executives of major companies, but for cybersecurity VCs who pick the right startup targets for investment, it&#8217;s a potential gold mine. Here at Extra Crunch, we compiled a list of top VCs who have invested in cybersecurity and enterprise more broadly and asked them what\u2019s interesting in the space these days. We compiled <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/29\/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-cybersecurity\/\">ten of their responses as part of our investor survey<\/a> and you should definitely take a look for their interesting takes on the space.<\/p>\n<p>But we wanted to go a bit deeper on the topic to learn more about what\u2019s happening right now in cybersecurity. So today, we talk with <a href=\"https:\/\/lsvp.com\/team\/arif-janmohamed\/\">Arif Janmohamed of Lightspeed Venture Partners<\/a>, one of the leading investors at one of the top enterprise VC firms in the world. He\u2019s invested in companies ranging from cloud-access security broker Netskope and search analytics platform ThoughtSpot to Qubole (big data analytics), Nutanix (hyper-converged infrastructure), and Arceo.ai (cyber risk management).<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1905044\" style=\"width: 440px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/29\/the-future-of-cybersecurity-vc-investing-with-lightspeeds-arif-janmohamed\/arif-head-color-web\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1905044\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1905044\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1905044\" title=\"Arif-head-color-web\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Arif-head-color-web.png\" alt=\"Arif head color web\" width=\"430\" height=\"490\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Arif-head-color-web.png 430w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Arif-head-color-web.png?resize=132,150 132w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Arif-head-color-web.png?resize=263,300 263w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Arif-head-color-web.png?resize=44,50 44w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-1905044\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Arif Janmohamed. <em>Image via Lightspeed Venture Partners<\/em><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch\u2019s security guru Zack Whittaker, managing editor Danny Crichton and operations editor Arman Tabatabai sat down with him to discuss what he\u2019s seeing at the earliest stages in cybersecurity, which trends are being ignored by the industry and what he sees as the future of security in an always-changing present.<\/p>\n<h2>Introduction and Background<\/h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Danny Crichton<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Let\u2019s start with a bit of your background.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Arif Janmohamed<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Sure. I&#8217;m on the early-stage side, so I have the most fun when I&#8217;m working with founders at the very earliest stages of company formation, where I can focus on company design, product and go-to-market and then find the right balance of teams to fill that out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m on the board of Netskope, which is a cloud-security company. That one I did the Series B back in 2013. I&#8217;m on the board of TripActions, which is a corporate travel company, I did that one and then led the Series A and the Series B. I&#8217;m on the board of Moveworks, which is an AI engine for IT that was seeded by me and then I&#8217;ve supported them through their subsequent financing. I&#8217;m also on the board of a number of other companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Am I purely security-focused? The answer is no, I&#8217;m very much enterprise-focused. Security in my mind really fits within that rubric of the enterprise stack that&#8217;s getting rebuilt for a cloud-first world.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"kZ11Bk6edj\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/29\/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-cybersecurity\/\">Where top VCs are investing in cybersecurity<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Where top VCs are investing in cybersecurity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/29\/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-cybersecurity\/embed\/#?secret=kZ11Bk6edj\" data-secret=\"kZ11Bk6edj\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>What&#8217;s snake oil and what has real value?<\/h2>\n<p><b>Zack<\/b> <b>Whittaker<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: So I&#8217;ve got a question that I just want to jump right in with.

scramble to catch up to streaming content platforms, more fundamental upheaval is headed their way as a result of technological advances in artificial intelligence and 5G.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former ProSiebenSat.1 executive Kevin Baxpehler (based in Tel Aviv) and former Google Ventures partner Eze Vidra (based in London) launched Remagine Ventures earlier this year with a $35 million fund that bridges the gap between technologists at the forefront of change and the largest owners of content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backed by a roster of multi-billion-dollar media companies in Europe, Asia and the U.S. as its limited partners, their firm operates independently (and focuses on financial return) but aims to provide strategic value to portfolio companies and insight into the future for its LPs. Vidra referred to it as \u201ca <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multi-corporate Google Ventures type of model.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The firm\u2019s focus on entertainment technologies has a B2B bent, with a geographic focus on Israel as its primary hub and with most of its initial portfolio selling to enterprise media companies. That makes Remagine\u2019s ability to guide entrepreneurs through the halls of traditional media giants highly relevant; it also means it can gauge whether traditional media companies are likely to buy a startup\u2019s product before they invest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spoke with Baxpehler and Vidra to learn more about their playbook and why they believe a wave of entertainment tech companies is about to come out of Israel. Here\u2019s the transcript of our conversation (edited for length and clarity):<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/eric-peckham\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"eric-peckham\">Eric Peckham: <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Are there specific investment theses within entertainment that you are hunting for startups in?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Kevin Baxpehler:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Our investment thesis is based on two main drivers: new advancements in so-called AI technologies \u2014 specifically deep-learning, computer-vision and NLP \u2014 coupled with new consumer trends such as esports, visual search, and engaging with computer-generated imagery (CGI) like Lil Miquela.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe that recent technological developments such as GANs (generative adversarial networks), coupled with new powerful computing power like new microprocessing chips and 5G, will change how brands, consumers, and stars\/influencers will all interact. It creates tremendous opportunities to invest.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Eze Vidra: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remagine Ventures invests independently in seed and pre-seed startups at the intersection of entertainment, tech, data and commerce. Seed investing is particularly hard for corporates to do directly (because of a combination of reasons including speed, signaling risk and the challenges of deal flow for corporates) so we specialise at that stage by sourcing real time feedback from the market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are seeing industries and disciplines converge and find the intersections to be the most ripe areas of opportunity. For example, content + commerce, AI + entertainment, gaming + live stream tech giving us esports as a cultural phenomenon changing consumer behaviour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Give me some examples of what startups at these intersection points will look like.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Vidra:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The two core tenants of our thesis are 1) changing consumer behavior \u2014 for example, how esports is moving young viewers to engage with gaming \u2014 and 2) new technologies that make new forms of entertainment possible, primarily driven by AI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our portfolio company <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.syte.ai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Syte<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an image-recognition and computer-vision company that recognizes the products inside images and videos with a very high degree of accuracy. They are working with top retailers globally and Samsung selected them to power the Bixby assistant and is rolling them out globally. It&#8217;s been tried before, but the difference with Syte\u2019s product is the level of accuracy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We invested in <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/hourone.ai\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HourOne,<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which is a synthetic video company using generative adversarial networks to generate video without the camera. It has multiple use cases, from reducing the cost of video production to programmatic video, to text-to-speech to gaming.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vault-ai.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vault<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which uses deep learning to predict the success of scripted projects, whether it&#8217;s movies or TV shows down to the box office opening Rotten Tomatoes scores, the probability of there being a season two, the demographics that are most impacted, etc. So bringing a more data-driven approach to marketing films and shows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being vertically-focused means that we can attract relevant dealflow from both entrepreneurs and co-investors. As we evaluate startups, we look for interesting teams that are leveraging new technology (or taking an interesting consumer angle) that can scale and we focus on helping them open doors internationally.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>To what extent is your interest focused on startups selling their technology to enterprise media companies versus startups building tools for the

scaling, initial pains are unlikely to displace London from its position as a global center for finance, media, retail, and technology.<\/p>\n<p>As UK-based startups reach $1 billion (~\u00a3800 million) valuations at a rate of one per month, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/WeAreTechNation\/unicorn-update-london-tech-week-2019\/WeAreTechNation\/unicorn-update-london-tech-week-2019\">according to data from Dealroom<\/a>, VC firms have raised $3.5 billion in new funds to fuel the next wave of investments.<\/p>\n<p>Interested to learn where that capital could flow, I asked nine of London&#8217;s top consumer-focused VCs to find out which specific trends they&#8217;re using to identify startup investment opportunities:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Julia Hawkins, Partner at LocalGlobe<\/li>\n<li>Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen, Partner at Balderton<\/li>\n<li>Sonali De Rycker, Partner at Accel Partners<\/li>\n<li>Christian Dorffer, Partner at Sweet Capital<\/li>\n<li>Danny Rimer, Partner at Index Ventures<\/li>\n<li>Reshma Sohoni, Managing Partner at Seedcamp<\/li>\n<li>Niall Wass, Partner at Atomico<\/li>\n<li>Paul Murphy, Partner at Northzone<\/li>\n<li>Nic Brisbourne, Partner at Forward Partners<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Their responses highlighted the diversify of funding interests in the ecosystem, but also show that banking, consumer health, transport, direct-to-consumer brands, and social entertainment remain hot areas.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Julia Hawkins, Partner at LocalGlobe<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m very focused on the healthtech sector and within consumer health, I&#8217;m particularly interested in the potential for digital therapeutics to enable people to gain control over habits and treat certain chronic conditions such as mental health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re thinking deeply about transportation, we\u2019re already investors in Citymapper, Beryl and Voi and see the huge potential to improve how people move around cities and influence how urban centers are planned, all while reducing pollution.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On that topic, we\u2019re watching the climate change debate closely and I\u2019m heartened by the fact that people everywhere are becoming wholly committed to reducing waste. Companies that can produce truly circular products for our families, homes and places of work I think will do well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s an incredibly interesting time in media with titanic worlds of video, gaming and music are shifting and I believe in the transformative power of games, music and immersive experiences \u2014 TikTok and Fortnite show just how powerful these can be and I believe new platforms such as Playdeo will make consuming media and entertainment much more active experiences in the future.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen, Partner at Balderton<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe are excited about the disruption within the European transportation sector, where we\u2019ve seen new types of vehicles, like e-scooters from VOI, and amazing advances in autonomous mobility solutions. Time is up for car ownership in many city centers and competition is fierce for environmentally-friendly alternatives. This creates an exciting opportunity to use tech to improve public transport options and to leverage the sharing economy which Citymapper offers, as well as overhaul the car hire sector as new players like Virtuo are aiming to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are also impressed by the continued innovation in the financial sector. We are long-time investors in fintech and have backed Revolut and GoCardless, amongst others. Traditional banks and financial incumbents are battling fragmented and outdated technology stacks to adapt to rapidly changing consumer demands, which creates a huge opportunity for startups.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Sonali De Rycker, Partner at Accel Partners<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019re excited about three key trends in consumer tech. The first is fintech, for which the UK has created a very supportive environment. A few large businesses are being built from London, like Monzo, buoyed by new rules written around retail banking and next generation financial services as well as huge, unmet customer demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second is healthtech. Healthcare is a large and untapped opportunity plagued by rising costs for providers and deteriorating patient experience. We are seeing a few platform companies that are finding ways to successfully solve these problems by providing digital healthcare to consumers, like Kry out of Sweden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With 72 unicorns created since 2009 and $8.7 billion in venture funding last year, the UK is Europe&#8217;s leading startup hub.
